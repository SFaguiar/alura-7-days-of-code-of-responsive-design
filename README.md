# Alura #7DaysOfCode in Responsive Design


## Official Description
During the 7 Days of HTML and CSS, you will practice the essence of Front-end. Theory is important, but it is important to always practice your knowledge, and one of the ways to practice HTML and CSS is to replicate or recreate the layout of a famous website. It was from this type of practice that the idea for the project you will develop came about: a replica of the LinkedIn profile page. You will use basic concepts like 'div', 'section', inline for images, responsive measures in CSS, as well as more advanced things like Flexbox, Grid and many others, things that anyone entering the Front-end area needs to know. After practicing these concepts for 7 days straight, you will see that remembering the syntax of each tag and what each one is for will no longer be a difficulty and you will be able to worry more about how to solve problems.

## DAY 1
On the very first day, you will be presented with the layout of a page in Figma, analyze it and use it to create the main profile information section, which contains the cover image, profile photo, name, title , contact information, career information, and at the end of the section, action buttons.

## DAY 2
Here you will develop the navigation menu, also known as the Navbar. In this section, you will have the LinkedI logo, a search bar and a set of links leading to other areas of the social network.

## DAY 3
On that day you will need to work a lot with alignment in CSS, and knowledge of Flexbox or Grid will make your life a lot easier! The section is called 'Featured Posts' and contains three cards side by side, all with certain visual items.

## DAY 4
On this day you will implement two parts of the screen today: the 'Recent activities' section, which contains text, images and dividing lines, and the 'About' section.

## DAY 5
This will probably be the most important challenge, as you will develop the 'Experiences' section, probably the most relevant on the page. It contains different groups of clustered blocks and various information about the person's past employment experiences.

## DAY 6
Reaching almost the end, you will develop the 'Academic training' and 'Languages' sections, which are very similar to some of the sections developed previously.

## DAY 7
On the seventh and final day of the challenge, you will create two very similar sections, which we will call profile suggestions sections. The first is called 'People also saw' and the second 'People you may know'. They have a slightly different shape and several buttons. Furthermore, you can publish your page for free on the internet, so that other people can access it and it can serve as a portfolio for you. You will close with a flourish!
